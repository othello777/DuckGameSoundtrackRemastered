# Duck Game Soundtrack Remastered
 A large overhaul of the DG OST project files to create as acurate as possible VGM/DGM exports.

The intitial goal is to create "good enough" VGM exports of most of the songs and then to perfect them later on.

Many of the FL Studio project files are using older versions of genny which need to be manually converted to the latest version of the plugin.
The two LibreOffice spreadsheets in the root directory have a lot of valuable information on all the project files.

`/ForGameFlac` is for high-quality renders of songs that cant be exported to VGM/DGM yet so they can be included in the game as a format such as QOA.  
`/ForSoundtrackFlac` is for a collection of high-quality renders intended to be listened to outside of the game.

## What is DGM?
Duck Game Music (DGM) is a file format created for those songs in the soundtrack that use more than one instance of the plugin. Currently it's just a zip with several VGMs indide that get played in sync with each other, but maybe in the future it will have metadata and even effects so more of the soundtrack can be exported.
